Add slot-specific app view selection and layered host views. Host contracts now declare `views` and `slots`; app clients register `slots[name][path]`. Each slot selects one matching view and composes context only from that view and its ancestors. Unsupported matches render nothing, and `false` entries stop fallback.

React integrations now import `Root`, `AppView`, `useApps`, and `useView` directly. Pass the client to `Root`, add a slot to every app view, publish only each view's own context, and regenerate app bindings. Registries are isolated per root.

Each slot declares a `views` list typed against the global view definitions. Generated app bindings and explicit host mounts enforce the slot-to-view relationship, and runtime matching only considers supported view paths while retaining inherited ancestor context.

Publish host view state with `useView(path, { context })` or `useView(path, { status })`.

The iframe runtime is bundled from TypeScript and accepts only default-exported `defineClient()` clients. Demo clients use that same contract. View ancestry is shared between React, the sandbox, and generated bindings. `Root` supplies one app-discovery state: when `apps` is provided, `useApps()` reads it and skips network discovery.
